## About me
    I’m Naveena Aeddula, a software developer with around 4 years of experience
    building backend applications using Python.

    I started my career at FYERS Securities, where I worked for about three years
    on large-scale fintech platforms. There, I was involved in developing critical
    systems like the Demat Account Opening platform, UCC integrations, and user
    account portals from scratch. I worked extensively with Python, Django, Flask,
    FastAPI, MySQL, and AWS, and integrated multiple third-party and exchange APIs
    such as NSE, BSE, MCX, and CDSL. This role gave me strong exposure to end-to-end
    development, production deployments on AWS, and handling real-world financial
    data using Pandas and NumPy.

    Currently, I’m working as a Software Developer at Sacumen, where my focus has
    shifted more towards cybersecurity and integrations. I design and build custom
    Python connectors and ETL pipelines that integrate threat intelligence feeds and
    vulnerability data into SIEM and SOAR platforms. I’ve built 20+ production-ready
    connectors, and automated incident detection workflows. My work here emphasizes 
    clean architecture, scalable microservices, Dockerized deployments, and reliable
    data enrichment.

    Overall, my strengths lie in Python backend development, REST APIs, ETL pipelines,
    AWS, and connector-based integrations. I enjoy working on complex backend problems,
    writing maintainable code, and collaborating closely with teams. I’m now looking for
    a role where I can continue building scalable backend systems while taking on more
    technical ownership.”


## Follow up questions
1. “What are you currently working on?”
    “Currently, I’m working at Sacumen on building Python-based connectors and ETL
    pipelines for cybersecurity platforms. My work mainly involves extracting 
    vulnerability and threat intelligence data from multiple external sources, 
    normalizing it, enriching it, and pushing it into SIEM and SOAR systems.

    I’ve built 20+ connectors that run in production, focusing on reliability, 
    scalability, and clean data contracts.
    The stack I use daily includes Python, FastAPI, Flask, Docker, AWS, 
    and unit testing.”


2. “Can you explain what a connector is?”
    “A connector is essentially a bridge between two systems. In our case, it’s a 
    Python service that securely connects external platforms like vulnerability 
    databases or threat intel feeds with internal SIEM/SOAR tools.

    A typical connector handles:
        Authentication with external APIs
        Data extraction (API, scraping, feeds)
        Data normalization and enrichment
        Error handling, retries, and logging
        Sending structured data to downstream systems

    At Sacumen, my connectors are built as modular, reusable Python services, often 
    containerized using Docker and deployed on AWS.”


3. “What kind of ETL pipelines have you built?”
    “I’ve built multiple ETL pipelines where the extraction layer pulls vulnerability 
    data from product advisory pages or APIs. The transformation layer cleans and 
    standardizes the data—like CVE IDs, severity, affected versions—and the load layer 
    pushes the data into security platforms for reporting and alerting.

    I focus a lot on:
        Data validation
        Handling partial or missing fields
        Idempotency to avoid duplicates
        Performance optimization for large datasets

    Most pipelines are written in Python, with structured logging and monitoring enabled.”


4. “Which Python frameworks are you most comfortable with?”
    “I’m most comfortable with FastAPI and Flask. I use FastAPI when I need high 
    performance, async support, and clear API contracts, especially for microservices. 
    Flask I’ve used extensively for simpler services and integrations.

    In my previous role at FYERS, I also worked with Django for form-based and
     data-heavy applications. Across all frameworks, I focus on clean architecture, 
     separation of concerns, and testability.”


5. “Can you talk about your AWS experience?”
    “I’ve worked hands-on with AWS in both my roles. I’ve deployed applications on EC2, 
    built Lambda functions for lightweight services, used S3 for storage, and CloudWatch 
    for monitoring and logs.

    I’m comfortable with:
        EC2-based deployments using Gunicorn and WSGI/ASGI
        Dockerized services
        Configuring load balancers and endpoints
        Debugging production issues using logs and metrics
    
    I understand AWS from a developer’s perspective rather than just theoretical usage.”


6. “What kind of challenges have you faced?”
    “One common challenge I’ve faced is inconsistent or unreliable external data from 
    third-party APIs or advisory sources. To handle this, I implemented robust validation, 
    fallback logic, retries, and alerting so failures don’t break the pipeline.


7. "Why are you looking for a change?"
    I was working on Akamai project as a contractor through Sacumen. Recently, 
    that engagement concluded due to business changes, and Sacumen no longer supports 
    that client. I’m now exploring new opportunities where I can continue contributing 
    as a Python backend developer and take on long-term technical ownership.
